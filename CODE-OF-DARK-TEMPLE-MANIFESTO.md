*A note on the following manifesto. It was written by a small group of collaborators in early 2016, in Ahmadabad, India. 
It is meant as a provocation, a declaration to a new sort of thinking in our ever connected, network ubiquitous society.
What will you do with it?*

#THE CODE OF THE DARK TEMPLE#

A/The Dark Temple is a void in the spectrum, an absence of signal, sphere of not-self in the ocean of electromagnetic waves.

In the age of electronic communication, wireless transmissions, mass surveillance and total transparency of the Individual, 
the Dark Temple represents a non-place, an emptiness in which one can be alone with their inner self or with others without 
interference from the World of electronic communication, artificial sensors and The World of Immaterial Work.

It is an un-place which one neither adds anything to nor takes anything away from. 
It is a black hole that does not allow wireless data and meta-data to escape, and therefore cannot be directly observed.

##Architecture of the Dark Temple##
A Dark Temple is meta-architectural structure mostly existing in the realm of electromagnetic spectrum.
There are Natural and Artificial Dark Temples. Natural Temples are scarcity, disappearing existence of 
places without signals. The One Who Wants To Conquer all frontiers and Control the Waves will tend to 
transform all the Natural Dark Temples into The Network and exploit, privatise and control the resources 
of the electromagnetic void.

An Artificial Dark Temple is the void in the electromagnetic waves usually artificially created with a 
use of different techniques, technology and structures performed or built by monks of the Dark Temple .

An Artificial Dark Temple has the shape of a sphere. This sphere is filled with an electromagnetic 
signal that creates noise and by that transforms the inside of the sphere into a field of invisibility 
and emptiness. The inside of the sphere is fullness and emptiness at the same time. It can be understood 
as a Dark Temple or White Temple simultaneously. The Temple can be ephemeral or eternal. 
It is omnipresent. 
It can be small or big.

The membrane, border or walls of the Dark Temple are fields of disturbance. 
Anyone entering the Dark Temple eventually leaves a trace, a signal of lost 
connection with The Network. The sum of those signals can trace the shape of 
The Dark Temple. This is how The One Who Controls will have a power over the 
Realm of Waves* and The Network can see the existence of the Dark Temple within 
its domain. Similar to the theory of the event horizon surrounding a black hole, 
the All-Watching Eye of the One Who Controls the Waves can observe events on the 
horizon, the border of the Dark Temple but nothing behind it.

The architectural representation of the Dark temple can be compared to the 
Garbha Griha or the Sanctum Sanctorum of a common temple. The inner void that 
disengages an individual from the realm of cyberspace.

##Order of the Dark Temple##
The Order of the Dark Temple is not an Order. 
It does not have a specific structure but has a set of fuzzy ethical principles that can evolve, 
be modified or disappear. The Order consists of all beings (human, non-human, transhuman or posthuman) 
that create or enjoy electromagnetic voids.

##Dark Temple Dynamics##
Even the Dark temple is a void, and there can be just one void - there can be many Dark temples. 
The Dark Temple can move, appear or disappear and merge with other Dark Temples. Dark Temples are 
nodes of the abstract network, The Internet of Nothing, that is the sum of all nodes existing in the present moment.

##Ethics of the Order of the Dark Temple##
Electronic nonviolence is the fundamental principle forming the cornerstone of its ethics and 
doctrine of the Order of the Dark Temple. Electromagnetic void, the substance of the Dark

Temple should not be imposed on others without their consent. A Dark Temple is not about jamming others, 
it is about creating a void for the purpose of enjoying personal freedoms and gaining a silence in the 
World of Noise. The choice to step out from the World of Noise into the Dark Temple should be the choice of the individual.

The Dark Temple is not a manifestation of technophobia or neo-luddism philosophy and not an advocate for 
complete absence of digital communication. The Dark Temple Order advocates for the balance and possibility 
that one should be able to isolate him/herself and should have a right to create electromagnetic voids.

The Order of the Dark Temple practices different forms of Digital Veganism outside of the Temples 
according to individual needs and choices.

##Code of The Dark Temple and its existence##
Code of the Dark Temple can be changed, modified or distributed by anyone. 
The Code does not belong to anyone but belongs to everyone. 
There is no one Code, there can be many in different forms and substance.

##Legality of Dark Temple or Right to be disconnected##
In the realm of State, electromagnetic spectrum is highly regulated and owned by the governments or private entities. Creation of void, disturbance or interference in electromagnetic spectrum is considered illegal in most of the countries. This is against the values of the Dark Temple Order which believes that anyone should have a right to be disconnected and to create a void in a nonviolent way.

##How to Create a Dark Temple##
There is no one way to create a Dark Temple, there are many. One should seek The Open Knowledge of the Do It Yourself in the fields of signal jamming, electromagnetic interference or faraday cage.
