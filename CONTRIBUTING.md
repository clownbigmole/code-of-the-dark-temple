**Thank you so much for choosing to contribute to this project!!**

#Project Vision#
The project is to write and present a future history as a collection of stories from the community, 
that paints a balanced, textured view of the future using the 'right to disconnect' or the manifesto 
of the 'code of the dark temple' as a starting provocation and binding element.

#What Should I Know Before I Get Started#
Here's a few things we reccommend you read/understand/browse before you get started. 

##Code of Conduct##
In trying to build a community that continues to be enthusiastic and energetic, we ask you to read and
adhere to our [code of conduct](https://github.com/clownbigmole/code-of-the-dark-temple/blob/master/CodeOfConduct.md). 

## Important Resources##
- [Readme](https://github.com/clownbigmole/code-of-the-dark-temple/blob/master/README.md)
- [Project Roadmap](https://github.com/edovio/OpenStudentBook/blob/master/roadmap.md)

##List of Communication Channels##
Currently we don't have a group chat we use. But do leave a comment on [this issue](https://github.com/clownbigmole/code-of-the-dark-temple/issues/1),
as we're quite open to suggestions at the moment. 

#How can I get involved#
There's primarily two streams of work at the moment: **Building stories and assets** and **Building the VR Exhibition** 

##Building stories and assets## 
###Getting Started###
The first thing to do while getting started in this process is to read the [manifesto](https://github.com/clownbigmole/code-of-the-dark-temple/blob/master/CODE-OF-DARK-TEMPLE-MANIFESTO.md). It is the root instigation/provocation for this project. There are more links shared by other contributors [here](https://github.com/clownbigmole/code-of-the-dark-temple/issues/2) that you can browse to get the old noggin working, and see what other community members are interested in. :) 

###Channels for Contribution###
There's three kinds of contributions you can make: 
####Provocations####
You can make provocations to the community, which could be a single line, with keyphrases, or the kernel of an idea. 
All provocations can be found [here](https://github.com/clownbigmole/code-of-the-dark-temple/labels/Provocation). 
**This is a really good first contribution to make to get involved!!** 

####Story####
Take one of the [provocations](https://github.com/clownbigmole/code-of-the-dark-temple/labels/Provocation) or [News pieces/blogposts](https://github.com/clownbigmole/code-of-the-dark-temple/issues/2) and turn it into a 3 - 4 line or fully realised story. Or take another person's [story](https://github.com/clownbigmole/code-of-the-dark-temple/labels/Story) and flesh it out, make suggestions or remix it and do something else with it! 

####Graphic Assets####
The ultimate aim is to create a set of assets, graphic and/or 3-dimensional, that will be included in the VR exhibition. So take a [story](https://github.com/clownbigmole/code-of-the-dark-temple/labels/Story) and start creating [graphic assets](https://github.com/clownbigmole/code-of-the-dark-temple/labels/GraphicAssets). Or help someone working on [graphic assets](https://github.com/clownbigmole/code-of-the-dark-temple/labels/GraphicAssets) with their work. 

##Building the VR Exhibition##
We're still figuring this out ourselves. If you're interested in contributing towards this or helping figure it out with us, then email akshayroongta@gmail.com! We're waiting to hear from you! 

**That's the long and short of it! Keep an eye on this doc, for updates, until then happy contributing! And thanks again for choosing to be part of this project. :)**
